## Remix - Fund Me

On this lesson we learned how to create payable functions in our
contracts via a "Fund Me" contract. We also went over how to revert
transactions if requirements are not met. Lastly, we learned how to
create a library to help us get current ETH/USD price and convert given
ETH to USD (to check for minimum contribution requirements).
